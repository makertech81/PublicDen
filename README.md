A web app version of Clubhouse. The most unsecured platform thus far. 

Almost a month ago I spent a weekend reverse engineering the Clubhouse API, unbeknownst to me, Zhuowei Zhang was working on hipster.house at the same time. Thus I didn't post anything, now that the Android app repo came out, I want to remake a web version of Clubhouse and use this as an oppourtunity to fool around and learn.
